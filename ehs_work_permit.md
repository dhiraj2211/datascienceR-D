# üîç Predictive Analysis Plan for ‚ÄúPermit to Work‚Äù Data

## 1. Overview
This analysis focuses on understanding and predicting the workflow of the **Permit to Work (PTW)** system.  
The data contains permit creation, approval, and completion details, allowing insights into efficiency, performance, and safety compliance.

---

## 2. Objectives
1. Analyze permit trends and patterns across departments, contractors, and locations.  
2. Identify reasons behind delays and rejections.  
3. Predict approval time, completion delay, or rejection likelihood.  
4. Recommend preventive actions to improve process efficiency.

---

## 3. Data Description
Typical columns captured in the PTW system include:

- **Requester Details:** Name, Mobile, Contractor, Work For, Department  
- **Permit Details:** Permit Type, Reason, Expiry, Site Control Room, Location  
- **Team Details:** Team Name, STC Number  
- **Timeline:** Start Date/Time, End Date/Time  
- **Contact Info:** Control Room Mobile, Hospital Mobile  
- **Permit Checklist:** Storage/Safety checklist data  
- **Status:** Approved, Rejected, Pending, Completed  
- **Additional Remarks:** Free-text remarks or comments

## 4. Types of Analysis

### A. Descriptive Analysis (What happened)
- Total number of permits created, approved, rejected, and pending.  
- Average approval and completion time.  
- Permit count by department, location, and contractor.  
- Peak hours/days/months of permit creation.  
- Common reasons for rejection or delay.  

‚úÖ **Purpose:** Understand workflow performance and basic trends.

---

### B. Diagnostic Analysis (Why it happened)
- Identify causes of delays or rejections (e.g., incomplete checklists, specific permit types).  
- Detect departments or contractors with repeated issues.  
- Correlate rejection or delay with specific reasons, dates, or timeframes.  

‚úÖ **Purpose:** Root cause identification and operational improvement.

---

### C. Predictive Analysis (What will happen)
- **Permit Approval Time Prediction:**  
  Predict how long a new permit will take to be approved based on historical data.
  
- **Permit Rejection Prediction:**  
  Predict the probability of a permit being rejected using permit type, department, and checklist data.
  
- **Completion Delay Prediction:**  
  Forecast whether a permit will exceed its expected completion time.

‚úÖ **Purpose:** Early warning and proactive decision-making.

---

### D. Prescriptive Analysis (What to do about it)
- Recommend best reviewer or department to assign for faster approvals.  
- Suggest optimal start/end times to reduce delay or overlap.  
- Recommend corrective actions for high-risk permits.  

‚úÖ **Purpose:** Decision optimization and workflow automation.

---

## 5. Visualization Ideas (Dashboards)
- **Permit Summary Dashboard:** Approved vs. Rejected vs. Pending permits  
- **Trend Analysis:** Permits created per week/month  
- **Performance Heatmap:** Delay rate by department/location  
- **Predictive Insights:** ‚ÄúRisk of Delay‚Äù or ‚ÄúExpected Approval Time‚Äù indicators  

‚úÖ **Tools:** Power BI, Tableau, Python (Plotly/Dash/Streamlit), or Django with Chart.js

## 6. Machine Learning Models

| Goal | Model Type | Example Algorithms |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| Predict Approval/Completion Time | Regression | Linear Regression, XGBoost Regressor |
| Predict Permit Rejection | Classification | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM |
| Cluster Similar Permits | Clustering | K-Means, DBSCAN |
| Detect Unusual Permit Patterns | Anomaly Detection | Isolation Forest |

---

## 7. Steps for Predictive Analysis

1. **Data Collection:** Export permit data (creation, approval, completion logs).  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, fix incorrect dates, normalize categorical fields.  
3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Calculate ‚ÄúApproval Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompletion Time.‚Äù  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., Department, Permit Type).  
   - Create delay/rejection flags.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize patterns and correlations.  
5. **Model Training:** Train regression/classification models based on goals.  
6. **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as R¬≤, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.  
7. **Deployment:** Integrate predictive outputs into dashboards or alert systems.

## 8. Outcome
The predictive analysis will help:
- Improve approval and completion efficiency.  
- Reduce rejection rates by addressing high-risk patterns.  
- Enable real-time prediction of delays or issues.  
- Support data-driven safety and operational decisions.
